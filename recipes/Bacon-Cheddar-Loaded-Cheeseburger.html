    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <li>5 strips bacon</li>
            <li>4 oz cream cheese(115 g), at room temperature</li>
            <li>>Â¼ cup green onion(35 g), thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese(100 g)</li>
            <li>1 lb ground beef(455 g)</li>
            <li>salt, to taste</li>
            <li>pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>4 slices cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>4 hamburger buns, toasted</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        <h2>Preparation</h2>
    </p>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>In a pan over medium-high heat, add the bacon, and cook until crispy. Transfer to a cutting board and roughly chop.</li>
            <li>In a bowl, add the bacon, cream cheese, green onions, and shredded cheddar. Mix well.</li>
            <li>Divide the ground beef into four even portions and shape into balls. Form a well into the center of each, large enough for the cheese mixture.</li>
            <li>Place a quarter of the cheese mixture into the center of each ball, and enclose inside the ground beef. Gently press each ball into a patty shape, and season both sides generously with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Heat a cast-iron pan over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the burgers and cook for 4-5 minutes on one side.</li>
            <li>Flip the burgers, and cook for 2 minutes. Add a slice of cheese on each burger and cook for an additional 2 minutes, until the burger is cooked through and the cheese is melted.</li>
            <li>Remove burgers from pan, and place on top a toasted burger bun. Top with condiments of your choice.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!
        </ol>
